# Process
Step 1: Data Cleaning
Checked for missing values in key columns and filled or removed as needed.
Standardized data types (e.g., numeric for guest counts, text for categories).
Ensured consistent formatting across the dataset.
Step 2: Data Preparation
Created calculated columns where required (e.g., total guests = adults + children + babies).
Verified categorical consistency in fields like hotel type, meal plan, and room preference.
Step 3: Pivot Table Creation
Built PivotTables to analyze:
Total guests by hotel type.
Year-wise reservation trends.
Booking cancellations vs. non-cancellations.
Preferred room types and meal plans.
Repeated guest and client type patterns.
Deposit types and waiting list durations.
Step 4: Dashboard Development
Combined all PivotTables into one Excel sheet.
Inserted appropriate charts (bar, line, pie) for visual representation.
Applied slicers for dynamic filtering by hotel, year, room type, and more.
Step 5: Finalization
Reviewed dashboard for clarity, interactivity, and insightfulness.
Ensured usability for data exploration and performance analysis.

# Project Insight
City Hotels attract more guests than Resort Hotels.
2016 had the highest number of bookings.
~35% of bookings were canceled, mainly from "No Deposit" reservations.
Guests mostly preferred the room type they initially reserved.
BB (Bed & Breakfast) is the most popular meal option.
Couples and Families make up the majority of clients.
Adults account for most bookings, with fewer children or babies.
Q3 (Julyâ€“Sept) saw the highest booking activity.
Repeated guests are low, showing room for loyalty improvement.
# Final Conclusion
To improve hotel performance, focus on City Hotels, target Couples and Families, and promote BB meal plans during peak Q3 season. Implement loyalty programs and optimize deposit policies to reduce cancellations and boost guest retention.
